# Finance JS
This is a simple web application for personal financial analysis.
It is intended to be used with a data from internet banking (an exported bank statements)
or with a manually created ones (a list of cash expenses).

Implemented storage options: REST API backend / Local Storage API.

**Online: https://harag.cz/app/finance**
- Local Storage only: Everything is processed (and optionally stored) in the browser â€“ no data is sent to the server.
